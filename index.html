                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p class="development-description">Back when MySpace was around, I was always fascinated with customizing and designing my profile page whether that be editing the layout, small font changes, or even adding music (remember that?). As MySpace died out, so did my interest in coding. Fast-forward to my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to learn languages such as C++, Assembly, and Ladder logc (for PLCs), while pursing my degree in Electrical Engineering and it resparked my interest in coding again. Although coding itself wasn't a huge emphasis in my studies, I did always find enjoyment taking those specific classes. As I entered my professional career, did I then begin to have more opportunities and exposure to code in languages such as Shell scripting, Java, and Python. Meanwhile, during my free time, exploring new languages such as HTML & CSS.</p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p class="data-engineering-concepts-description">Starting at a young age, music has always been a part of my life. In my early years, I started taking piano lessons and have to admit, it didn't last too long. As I went through grade school, middle school, and highschool, I picked up and continued with instruments including the viola, baritone, and tuba, while participating in our districts orchestra and marching band program. After a total of 9 years on the viola, 1 year on the baritone, and 4 years on the tuba, it was time to find something new. Nowadays, I dabble around with the piano as well as guitar.</p>
